### URECA (Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus)

I participated in NTU's URECA programme in my second year. I helped to develop a webpage plug-in that automatically detects fake news related to COVID-19 when a user goes to a new website, with the use of a machine learning model that was trained on a dataset with over 30k webpages. I mainly focused on developing the browser package, using Javascript, HTML, CSS and integrating Python into the Chrome plugin (with the use of Flask).
