### Google Hackathon for Startups 2022

Along with 4 of my good friends, we joined the Google Hackathon and managed to get into the top 5 teams. We were invited to the Google HQ to give a live pitch of our product, which was a fully functional web application to help determine the best location for meetups. I focused on building the algorithm for the application, using Python to calculate the base coordinates for any number of different starting locations. I also had to work extensively with the Google API to gather the actual addresses and location information for the UI. 

We also got featured on our school website for our achievement:

### URECA (Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus)

I participated in NTU's URECA programme in my second year. I helped to develop a webpage plug-in that automatically detects fake news related to COVID-19 when a user goes to a new website, with the use of a machine learning model that was trained on a dataset with over 20k webpages. I mainly focused on developing the browser package, using Javascript, HTML, CSS and integrating Python into the Chrome plugin (with the use of Flask).
