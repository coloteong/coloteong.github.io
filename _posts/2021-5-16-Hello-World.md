title: Hi! Welcome To My Website ðŸ˜Š
---

Hello, I'm Claudia. I'm currently in my last year in Nanyang Technological University, and I'm studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. My interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the field of AI. 

In my free time, I love to watch educational videos on linguistics, as well as music. I like to pick up new musical instruments too, I play the piano and a little bit of acoustic guitar, ukulele and cajon. I was also the lead for my hall's Jam Band, and played the keyboard for the songs we performed.

Fun fact: the song that is embedded in this website is **Claudia by Finneas**!
