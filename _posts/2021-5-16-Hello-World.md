Hello, I'm Claudia. I'm currently starting my 3rd year in Nanyang Technological University, and I'm studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. My interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the field of AI. 

In my free time, I love to watch educational videos on linguistics, as well as music. I like to pick up new musical instruments and I play the piano and a little bit of acoustic guitar, ukulele and cajon. I am also in my hall's Jam Band, and have led it for a year.
